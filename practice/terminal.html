 <h1>Welcome to How to Make a Website</h1>
 <hr>
 <h2>Steps Before Vim</h2>
 <p>Hi if this is your first time making a website great. I am going to go through the procces of setting up and making you first website.</p>
 <ul>
<li>First you need to make sure you have a github repository, and make sure it's linked to terminal. If you have this done your almost ready.</li>
<li>Finally make a file for all your websites to go in like <cite>Practice</cite> the practice folder is where all your websites will go.</li>
 </ul>
<hr>
<h2>First Website</h2>
<p>In the terminal, make sure you're in your practice folder, and then type this into the line</p>

<p>echo "your text" &lt; practice.html Enter</p>

<p>Then type ls and make sure that you have a new file called practice.html</p>

<p>This will add the text to your website you can now visit your website <cite>name of repo.github.io/practice/practice.html</cite></p>
<hr>
<h2>Starting vim</h2>
<p>Now we are going to be editing our website <cite>vim practice.html</cite> this is going to allow you to edit your website.</p>

<p>You can type whatever you want on vim though certain things might not work so keep it simple just words.</p>

<p>When your done writing what you want hit escape and type <cite>:wq</cite>. This will save your work then send you back to terminal.</p>

<ul>
<li>Once you're back in terminal type <cite>git add practice.html</cite> this will add you updates to github</li>
<li>Next you will type <cite>git commit -m "add text"</cite> this will tell github that you are certain that you want to add your update. REMEMBER TO ALWAYS ADD -M OTHERWISE TERMINAL WILL BE MAD.</li>
<li>Finally type <cite>git push</cite> that pushes your update to github to update your website. ALWAYS REMEMBER TO DO THIS.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Starting HTML</h2>
<p>In this you will be typing the most minimal HTML you can type. Later we will add font color and more.</p> 
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Homepage&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First website&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p> This code is the minimal HTML you can type. The building blocks for all websites. Without this you can't link stuff put images, and much more. </p>
<p>What about new lines look below 
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Homepage&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;<cite>To add new lines</cite>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;<cite>Just add new lesser than and greater than signs with p in them</cite>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<hr>
<h2>More Advanced HTML</h2>
<p>There are many different things you can do with HTML as I said it is the building blocks for everything. Now I am going to tell you some things you can do with HTML</p>
<h3>Some Code for Text</h3>
