 <h1>Welcome to How to Make a Website</h1>
 <hr>
 <h2>Steps Before Vim</h2>
 <p>Hi if this is your first time making a website great. I am going to go through the procces of setting up and making you first website.</p>
 <ul>
<li>First you need to make sure you have a github repository, and make sure it's linked to terminal. If you have this done your almost ready.</li>
<li>Finally make a file for all your websites to go in like <cite>Practice</cite> the practice folder is where all your websites will go.</li>
 </ul>
<hr>
<h2>First Website</h2>
<p>In the terminal, make sure you're in your practice folder, and then type this into the line</p>

<p>echo "your text" &lt; practice.html Enter</p>

<p>Then type ls and make sure that you have a new file called practice.html</p>

<p>This will add the text to your website you can now visit your website <cite>name of repo.github.io/practice/practice.html</cite></p>
<hr>
<h2>Starting vim</h2>
<p>Now we are going to be editing our website <cite>vim practice.html</cite> this is going to allow you to edit your website.</p>

<p>You can type whatever you want on vim though certain things might not work so keep it simple just words.</p>

<p>When your done writing what you want hit escape and type <cite>:wq</cite>. This will save your work then send you back to terminal.</p>

<ul>
<li>Once you're back in terminal type <cite>git add practice.html</cite> this will add you updates to github</li>
<li>Next you will type <cite>git commit -m "add text"</cite> this will tell github that you are certain that you want to add your update. REMEMBER TO ALWAYS ADD -M OTHERWISE TERMINAL WILL BE MAD.</li>
<li>Finally type <cite>git push</cite> that pushes your update to github to update your website. ALWAYS REMEMBER TO DO THIS.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Starting HTML</h2>
<p>In this you will be typing the most minimal HTML you can type. Later we will add font color and more.</p> 
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Homepage&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First website&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p> This code is the minimal HTML you can type. The building blocks for all websites. Without this you can't link stuff put images, and much more. </p>
<p>What about new lines look below 
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Homepage&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;<cite>To add new lines</cite>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;<cite>Just add new lesser than and greater than signs with p in them</cite>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p> Most of the code after this will be going into the body unless I say that it goes into the head.</p>
<hr>
<h2>More Advanced HTML</h2>
<p>There are many different things you can do with HTML as I said it is the building blocks for everything. Now I am going to tell you some things you can do with HTML</p>
<h3>Some Code for Make Your Page Look Better</h3>
<ul>
	<li>First use &lt;pre&gt; to display preformatted text for things like music or poems.</li>
	<li>Second us &lt;kbd&gt; to show keybord inputs <kbd>Ctrl+shift+q</kbd>.</li>
	<li>Third us &lt;br&gt; to create a new line of text within one line. Or use &lt;hr&gt; to do the same thing but with a line inbetween</li>
	<li>Fourth use &lt;del&gt; to cross stuff out.</li>
	<li>Fith you can use &lt;mark&gt; to highlight stuff.</li>
	<li>Sixth &lt;sup&gt; is for putting numbers or letters above the avarge text, and &lt;sub&gt; is for putting stuff under the original text.</li>
	<li>Seventh use &lt;h1&gt; you can use everything from h1 to h5these are headers, the numbers determain the size of the headers.</li>
	<li> Finally use &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; to make a list. Also use &lt;ol&gt; for an ordered list use this instead of &lt;ul&gt;, and for a defintion list use these &lt;dl&gt; &gt; &lt;dt&gt; &gt; &lt;dd&gt; </li>
</ul>
<p> These are some tips to format your website the way that you want. Like making a list or or adding headers.</p>
<p> These are essential if you want your website to look good</p>
<h3>How To Tables</h3>
<p>Now tables are very hard and take a long time to make so I am going to show you just how to make it so you don't get confused.</p>
  <p> What you see below is the base code for a table. While it might be confusing I will try to explain.</p>
        &lt;table&gt;
                    &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;th&gt;Day&lt;/th&gt;
                    &lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;
                    &lt;th&gt;Subject&lt;/th&gt;
                    &lt;/tr&gt;
                    &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;Enter Text&lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;Enter Text&lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;Enter Tex&lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
	<p>This is a simple graphs code that shows you how to make one. But it can be much more complicated depending what you want to add. Also I looks very complicated but once you understand it is much easier.</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Some CSS</h2>
	<p> This is just a small bit of CSS to make your background and text color look better. 
	<p> Body {</p>
	<p> color: white;</p>
	<p> background-color:black;</p>
	<p> font-weight: Bold;
	}</p>
	<p> This goes in the head.</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>HTML/CSS Valid</h2>
	<p> Always make sure your HTML and CSS code are valid.</p>
	<p> by using this code &lt;script src="js/validate.js"&gt; use this if your js validator is in the practice folder.</p>
	<p> If your js validator is not in the practice folder then use this &lt;script src="../js/validate.js"&gt; this will pull it from another file to use it.
